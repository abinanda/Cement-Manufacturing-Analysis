Quality Control Teams:

Based on historical data, can we identify periods with consistently low residue levels (Residue) that suggest stable product quality, potentially reducing testing frequency during those times?
Are there specific patterns or trends in residue data that can help streamline the quality control process and reduce the time required for testing?
Can we identify historical patterns or anomalies in residue data that have historically led to extended testing times
Production Teams:

How can we use mill throughput data (Mill TPH) to optimize production schedules and minimize testing-related delays?
Are there correlations between fan speeds (Mill Vent Fan RPM, CA Fan RPM) and testing time, and can we adjust fan settings for more efficient testing?
What process adjustments can be made based on separator performance data (Sep RPM) to reduce testing time and increase production efficiency?
Plant Managers:

Can we review historical data on power consumption (Mill KW) and find instances where lower energy consumption coincided with reduced testing time, thus highlighting energy-efficient modes of operation?
Are there temperature profiles (Mill I/L Temp, Mill O/L Temp) that, when monitored, can lead to faster testing without compromising product quality?
Can draft pressure data (Draft values) at various points in the system be used to streamline testing processes and minimize downtime during testing?
